I came across a tweet by Sultan Akintunde about AltSchool Africa and the work they do, while I have been looking for a well structured course with flexible payment options, and just when news of an industrial action by the Academic Staff Union of Universities was brewing, AltSchool fits in just perfectly to my wants and situation. I enrolled at AltSchool Africa as part of the premier AltSchoolers to learn more about web development and I'm currently taking in diploma in Software Engineering majoring in Frontend, learning React.js, Vue.js, CSS & CSS Preprocessors, Redux, and other frameworks like Next.js. I also work with no-code tools like Webflow. I'm currently interning as a Software Developer at Raenest.",
